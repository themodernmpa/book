## The Modern MPA

_Staving off the SPA by pushing your Multi Page App as far as possible_

It's happening. You can feel it in your bones. You've been hoping to avoid _the discussion_ for as long as possible, but someone finally came out and said said the S word. 

SPA. 

Maybe you're starting a new project, and everyone is brainstorming. How do we build this thing? API + SPA?

Maybe you have an existing project, and now you're being asked to do some things that are really hard to do without a persistant JS process. Maybe even impossible to do, but when you step back you just really can't justify rewriting the whole frontend _just for these few things_. 

Maybe you're starting a new project. You've been cranking out CRUD sites for years and you're good at it, and you know that most projects are 90% CRUD. You're reluctant to discard years of hard-earned skills just because some of the project _might_ need some non-crud patterns.

Whatever your reason, what you're really wrestling over is you're wondering "Is a SPA the right way to go? Why can't we take our MPA to the next level? It's 2019 now, what _is_ the next level for an MPA?"

This book is for you. We'll discuss a variety of techniques and patterns that you can use to stave off the impending SPA invasion, possibly indefinitely, but most certainly until you know that you know that you need it.


### The Author
I'm Titus, and I'm a full-stack web application engineer. For the last 15 years I've worked on every aspect of a modern web application. If you had the money, and the time, I've made it my goal to be the guy you'd talk to about building a clone of Facebook + *some other feature*. Of course, we wouldn't actually be talking because people who want to clone Facebok *+ some other feature* never actually *have* money, just hopes that *some other feature* is worth something on its own.

The most persistant question of the last 8-ish years of my career has been that of to SPA or not to SPA. The question arrises from all sides. Fellow developers, project managers, CEOpfules [^1]... something about the term "Single-Page" makes a SPA _sound_ so much easier. 

I can't answer the question *for* you, but in this book I will outline a series of techniques that I've successfully used to mitigate, and even entirely delay the introduction of a SPA framework.
