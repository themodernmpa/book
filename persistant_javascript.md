## Persistant Javascript

- Avoiding Orphaned event handlers
- Avoiding orphaned timers and timeouts
- Avoiding memory leaks
- Forced-refreshes for new deployments (reiteration of section from Turbolinks chapter)
- Persistant UI Elements with `data-turbolinks-permenant`
  - Abusing the single-initiation of a Stimulus controller's `initialize()` method
